# GettingAndCleaningDataProject

This project is for gathering and tidying data from a study for determining activities from a mobile device such as a cell phone. The project contains the following files.

- README.md: This file
- CodeBook.md: A markdown document describing the data sets and the processing required to make them relevant tidy data sets.
- run_analysis.R: A R script that defines functions for implementing the requirements in the CodeBook.md.

The gathering and formatting of data can be performed by importing the run_analysis.R into a R environment and running the function run_analysis.

Thank you for your time.
